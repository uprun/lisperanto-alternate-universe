what I want to achieve with js-repl:
edit-text
do not add more features than needed
save on [Command+Enter] -- save always
evaluate js code?? --- nope really
create new version of code and deploy it in container -- it can be done later
ough and it should be done fast, within one day -- it already took me more than one day but it is ok
don't be afraid to use extra libraries - but not many libraries
hello
really
and
?
