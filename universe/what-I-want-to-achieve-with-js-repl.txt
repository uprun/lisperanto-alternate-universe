 what I want to achieve with ~~js-repl~~ lisperanto:

[X] edit-text done on 2023-11-19 09:00
do not add more features than needed
[X] save on [Command+Enter] -- save always
[X] evaluate js code?? --- nope really
create new version of code and deploy it in container -- it can be done later
ough and it should be done fast, within one day -- it already took me more than one day but it is ok
don't be afraid to use extra libraries - but not many libraries
here goes the test?

I do not exactly remember what I did here ... I need to simplify
    done
so, I do not need to add a lot of features
   No version control
   nothing fancy
   super-light-weight code
   less dependencies
       so I got rid of knockout.js feels good, though library is good as well but I shall see what can I do on my own
   let's try it out
