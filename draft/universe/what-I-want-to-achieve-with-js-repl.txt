Title
 what I want to achieve with ~~js-repl~~ lisperanto:
Start date
 2023-11-15 22:38
[X] edit-text done on 2023-11-19 09:00
do not add more features than needed
[X] save on [Command+Enter] -- save always
[X] evaluate js code?? --- nope really
create new version of code and deploy it in container -- it can be done later
ough and it should be done fast, within one day -- it already took me more than one day but it is ok
don't be afraid to use extra libraries - but not many libraries
here goes the test?
